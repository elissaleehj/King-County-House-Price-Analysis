# King-County-House-Price-Analysis

Introduction:
This is the second capstone project for Springboard's Data Analysis Career Track Certification.

This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle, and homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction

Objective:
Management from a real estate agency has asked the analytics team to initiate further research on the current housing market, looking into features such as housing prices, geographic location, grade and condition ratings, and property age. Additionally, a customer has recently put their waterfront property on the market. Management has asked the analytics team to predict the price of this property based on previous housing data. 

Tools used:
The data was cleaned through Excel and Python. Further exploratory and predictive analysis was created through Python and Tableau. 

Key Findings

#### Key Findings

##### 1. Housing Prices

Based on House Price Histogram, the average house price was \\$540,000 and the mode was approximately \\$300,000. The housing prices were heavily skewed to the right with 75% of the data priced between \\$75,000 ~ \\$645,000 and the remaining data being higher.
##### 2.Geographic Location

Based on the jointplot, data of houses bought were concentrated between latitude: 47.6 to 47.8 and longitude: -122.2 to -122.4. We can infer that these geographic locations were ideal place to buy a house. 

When these geographic coordinates were visualized using google maps, Ballard, Fremont, Capital Hill and West Seattle appeared to be densely colored in red, proving popular property purchases in these particular locations. 


##### 3. Grade Rating
Based on boxplot, we can visually see an increase in the average house prices by higher grade rating and condition rating. 
Grade 7-8 seems to be the most common in house grade for buyers with an average price between \\$400K ~ \\$550K. 


##### 4. Property Age and Remodeling

Based on the barchart, newer properties were purchased more frequently than older properties. As properties age through year, the total purchases declines while the percent of remodeled property increases. 

70 years seems to be the turning point for a property. The number of possible buyers decreased roughly by half after 70 years since being built, and the percentage remodeled surpased 10%. The remodeled percentage continues to increase further with age.
